Tried to run Vgg19 vs Resnet18 on Cifar10 dataset, as well as using torch.compile fix for zailu approx, but torch.compile wasn’t working on jupyter

Ran the activation function timing benchmarks instead locally with optimized activation functions using torch.compile and optimized version of arctan and arctan_approx
