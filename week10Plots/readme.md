Ran Vgg19 and Resnet18 on Cifar10 dataset, with different activation functions zailu, and zailu approx.

Resnet: Accuracy improved to be about 10% higher than using Vgg16, with it hovering between 86-88% accuracy for both activation functions. Test loss and train loss overall decreased

Vgg19: Weird graphs, accuracy was very low at about 10%
